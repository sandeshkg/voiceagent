### **Late Payment and Related Policies**
1. **Due Date Clarity**: Borrowers must ensure payments are made by the due date specified in the loan agreement.
2. **Grace Period**: A grace period of 7–10 days may be provided post-due date without incurring penalties.
3. **Late Payment Charge**: Payments made after the grace period will attract a late payment charge of 2% of the overdue amount, with a minimum charge of ₹500.
4. **Recurring Delays Penalty**: If late payments occur for 3 or more consecutive months, an additional penalty may be imposed on subsequent delays.
5. **Partial Payment Rules**: Partial payments are considered insufficient if overdue amounts remain; late charges will apply to the balance.
