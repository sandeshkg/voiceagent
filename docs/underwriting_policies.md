**Underwriting Policies**

1. **Eligibility Criteria**  
   - **Minimum Age Requirement**: Applicants must be at least 18 years old. This ensures they meet the legal contracting age in the United States and Canada. Staff should verify the applicant's date of birth using government-issued identification documents such as a passport, driver’s license, or state ID.  
   - **Valid Driver's License**: A driver’s license issued by a state or province is required as proof of identity and driving eligibility. Ensure the license is not expired and matches the applicant's name on other submitted documents.  
   - **Residency Requirement**: Applicants must provide proof of permanent residence. Acceptable documents include utility bills, lease agreements, or property tax receipts. Staff should ensure the address on these documents matches the address provided in the application. Temporary or P.O. Box addresses are not acceptable.

2. **Income Verification**  
   - Applicants must submit proof of steady income. Acceptable documents include pay stubs (from the last three months), bank statements, or tax returns. Staff should verify the consistency of income and ensure the documents are authentic and unaltered.  
   - The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio must be below **35% for new vehicle loans** and **40% for used vehicle loans**. Calculate the DTI ratio by dividing the applicant's total monthly debt payments by their gross monthly income. If the DTI exceeds the threshold, the application should be flagged for further review.

3. **Creditworthiness**  
   - A **minimum credit score of 650** is required for new vehicle loans, while **600** is required for used vehicle loans. Staff should obtain the applicant's credit report from a reliable credit bureau and verify the score.  
   - Applicants with a credit score under 700 will receive higher interest rates to mitigate risk. Staff should clearly communicate the interest rate adjustments to the applicant and document their acknowledgment.

4. **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**  
   - For new vehicles, the LTV ratio can be up to **120%**, covering additional costs like taxes, fees, and warranties. Staff should calculate the LTV ratio by dividing the loan amount by the vehicle's purchase price or invoice value.  
   - For used vehicles, the LTV ratio is capped at **100%** based on Kelley Blue Book or NADA Guide values. Ensure the vehicle's valuation is accurate and up-to-date.

5. **Down Payment Requirements**  
   - A mandatory down payment of **10%** for new vehicles and **15%** for used vehicles applies. Staff should verify the source of the down payment to ensure it is legitimate and not borrowed.

6. **Vehicle Age and Condition**  
   - Used vehicles must be **under 10 years old** or have fewer than **100,000 miles**. Staff should obtain a vehicle history report (e.g., CARFAX) and ensure the vehicle meets these criteria.  
   - Independent vehicle inspections are required before financing approval. Staff should coordinate with certified inspection agencies and document the inspection results.

7. **Co-Signer Policies**  
   - A co-signer may be required for applicants with a credit score below 600. The co-signer must have a stable income and a credit score above 700. Staff should verify the co-signer's financial stability and ensure they understand their obligations.

8. **Fraud Prevention Measures**  
   - Staff must be vigilant for signs of fraudulent activity, such as inconsistencies in documentation or unverifiable information. Use fraud detection tools and cross-check applicant details with public records.

9. **Environmental and Safety Compliance**  
   - Ensure the vehicle complies with local environmental and safety regulations. Staff should verify that the vehicle has passed emissions tests and safety inspections where applicable.

10. **Loan Terms and Conditions**  
    - Clearly explain the loan terms, including interest rates, repayment schedules, and penalties for late payments. Staff should ensure the applicant fully understands and agrees to the terms before finalizing the loan.

11. **Customer Support and Follow-Up**  
    - Provide applicants with a point of contact for any questions or concerns during the loan process. Staff should follow up with applicants to ensure they have all necessary information and support.
